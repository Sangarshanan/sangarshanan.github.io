Welcome 2025

lmao you are gonna turn 27 bitch

this year started with my first solo trip to Rajasthan, I made some nice friends in Pushkar and then headed to Bir to meet the Sanket and Poojith, That was fun

I saw Marc Rebillet aka loop daddy live in Goa!!! explores Goa quite a bit this time, visited it again for christmas and boiler room, I did 3 boiler rooms this year: Blore, Bombay and Goa

Euro Trip was so amazing, I saw the Alps, Hiked in innsbruck, Partied my ass off in Berlin, met some really cool backpackers along the way and yet again enjoyed the company with EuroPython friends :) 

Found Aditi. best find of this year 10/10, she arrived at my door for my birthday with a paperback of the unbearable lightness of being and butterscotch cake, I had just earlier done an amazing hike on acid with Raja, Sudo and Rohit. 
This was one of the best birthdays I have had!

My social life is bonkers, after years of complaining i have no friends or a partner lmao, now i have to plan and prioritize situations, 
I want be clear on what i wanna do more rather than just going 
with a plan just because of the feeling that my friendships are conditional

YOUR FRIENDSHIPS AREN'T CONDITIONAL

I went on small trips this year, nothing long & major apart from europe, 
Bangalore has been fun and i just really enjoy being in love i guess.

Played at a CLUB for the first time as a livecoding DJ and also did the Algorave in December with Vivek on the bass, got paid for both those performances!

Decided to apply to UPF for a music tech masters, lets see how that pans out.

Went to Dharamkot for new year and had the time of my life again, 
made new friends this time and we started going on these crazy trail runs in the morning, 
Went to Triund again, this time with Lohit.
