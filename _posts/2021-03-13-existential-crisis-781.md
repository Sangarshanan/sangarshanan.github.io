What will I do without my Obsessions ? I want to be liked by everyone. I want to know about everything. I want to be the one with the wittiest responses. I want to be cool. I want to be funny. I want to be loved. I want to be curious. I want friends.

Everything I do is to feed my obsession

I keep saying this to myself: I am lucky, I am happy, I love to feed my obsessions and they give me joy and isn't that the point ? to be happy ? To be better ?

But it will never end now, will it ? The chase for glory. It's infinite

My friends and family have started saying I work a lot, they might be right.

I took sometime off last week for a family event, I spent a lot quality time with my family but felt guilty about it. I know I shouldn't but I did.
