Be Bored\
Please Be Bored\
Do Nothing\
Empty your mind\
Extend into the infinite expanse\
Stay with me\
Says the voice\
When I look in the mirror

----

Sat on the ground with a heavy head\
Closed my eyes\
I see dread\
Guts spilt into the abyss\
Moving shapes and intricate Patterns\
extending to infinity\
Am I just a projection\
of stolen personalities

----
I died\
I came back\
I didn't recognise myself\
never had that knack\
A long way to go\
I tell myself\
flickering lights in a shady bar\
eyes wide open and mind in musing\
when will I understand ?\
I don't always find the right phrasing\
flickering lights in a shady bar\
your journey is yet to start\
Rejoice\
For you've come this far

----
Fairy lights and wine glasses\
Faces so lively\
Surrounded by people\
I'm so lonely\
I wanna go\
No stay\
What if I miss\
The stories, oh what a day

----
Moon wearing her crescent\
Stars in all their glory\
Just me alone, a present soul\
Living out my story\
I have everything I want\
Nothing more nothing less\
Boundless joy and Entropy\
What a beautiful mess

----
It's just me\
It's just me\
There's noone else

----
You look up to me\
Eyes Red\
Filled with dread\
Kill me\
You said\
But baby\
You're already dead

----

Is your soul at Zero Entropy ?

---

Random acts of kindness\
Make strangers smile and so will you\
Unconditional love in abundance\
Makes Heaven a place on Earth

---

And in the blink of an eye\
My whole world changes

---

They are taking pictures\
You don't take pictures do you\
You don't give a shit\
You sit on my balcony\
Look around judging people\
You can stay still\
You can't stop moving\
For hours\
You lick you growl\
You stay silently still\
What are you thinking

---

That's a star\
Hidden between the clouds\
Its a million miles away\
Its moving away from you\
Light years ahead\
It gets dimmer and dimmer\
One day its no more\
It's not just this star with this fate\
Every star observable to us\
Will disappear forever\
Die out of sight\
Until one day\
The beautiful night sky we relish\
Will become a myth\
A Fairytale for the innocent\
Oh how the stars would shine\
They shine now\
They shine for you\
Just look up

---

Am I living\
or just keeping myself occupied

---

I feel uneasy\
I do not know what to do\
I swing my leg left and right\
restless\
Just shut your eyes\
Breathe

---
