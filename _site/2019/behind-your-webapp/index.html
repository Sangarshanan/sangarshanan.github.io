I just wrote the logic and Flask did it for me and I was able to get stuff done really fast</p> <p>It’s almost similar even when you look at other frameworks like Django</p> <p>Django provides tons of stuff out of the box for you like routing, views, templates, authentication, middleware and a whole lot more with a very rich documentation so that you are always in your comfort zone. And with a huge community any issue I faced with Django was one stackoverflow answer away</p> <p>These frameworks wrap everthing up so you just write in your logic and you are able to send requests and handle responses</p> <p>By running your application and sending HTTP requests, you realise 3 things happening in the HTTP flow</p> <ol> <li> <p>You open a TCP connection: (In my case it’s the localhost) The TCP connection is used to send a request, or several, and receive an answer.

</code></pre></div></div> <p>Now you close or reuse the connection</p> <p>But then how the hell do these python framework handle HTTP requests ? Cause it seems like magic… and I would love to learn a trick or two so let’s break it down :D</p> <p>Well maybe your site is static and you have all your files saved</p> <p>Then for every request you already have corresponding static file as a reponse… awesome this is really fast, you could do tons of caching techniques and it’s all really easy and straightforward but I mean it’s static which means that you have to manually go and edit the html files every time</p> <p>To solve this issue arose the Common gateway interface which invokes a script that dynamically generates the web page</p> <hr /> <p><em>Common Gateway Interface (CGI) offers a standard protocol for web servers to execute programs that execute like console applications (also called command-line interface programs) running on a server that generates web pages dynamically</em></p> <hr /> <p>The HTTP request that comes in breaks down into ENV variables which act as input and invokes a script which acts as a function and you get your output as an STDOUT… So if you just print hello world, it would be yout http response</p> <p>As cool and simple as all this sounds, you can’t afford to run the script every time you get a request</p> <p>So we need a seperate out the web server and the python application</p> <p>Enter WSGI</p> <p>Or as the cool people call it Web server gateway interface</p> <p>WSGI can be implemented with a simple function and every time there is a request we just call the function instaead of running an entire script</p> <hr /> <p><em>It is a specification that describes how a web server communicates with web applications, and how web applications can be chained together to process one request</em></p> <p><em>WSGI is not a server, a python module, a framework, an API or any kind of software. It is just an interface specification by which server and application communicate</em></p> <hr /> <p>Well this means freedom cause we don’t really need to worry about web servers like nginx or apache given that they understood this common interface and we could easily switch anytime we wanted to</p> <p>Also there is a really cool article comparing these two web servers <a href="https://serverguy.com/comparison/apache-vs-nginx/">https://serverguy.com/comparison/apache-vs-nginx/</a></p> <p>And if you wanted to build your own framework then you don’t have to know a whole lot of HTTP and instead build something that implements this simple function (The one below is Gunicorn)</p> <div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>def app(environ, start_response):
    data = b"Hello, World!\n"
    start_response("200 OK", [
        ("Content-Type", "text/plain"),
        ("Content-Length", str(len(data)))
    ])
    return iter([data])
</code></pre></div></div> <p>This function take two arguments</p> <ul> <li> <p>start_response: This is invoked with a status code, headers and an iterable data that you wanna send back (here it’s the generic hello world)</p> </li> <li> <p>environ: Well this is dictionary with some information like REQUEST_METHOD, PATH_INFO, SERVER_PROTOCOL etc</p> </li> </ul> <p>WSGI servers like Gunicorn are designed to handle many requests concurrently. Frameworks are not made to process thousands of requests and determine how to best route them from the server. They can also communicate with multiple web servers and keep multiple processes of the web application running. They can also async (Bjoern which is actually faster but not compatible with HTTP/1.1)</p> <hr /> <p>Gunicorn describes itself as a Pre-fork web server which means that a master creates forks which handle each request. A fork is a completely separate process and the “pre” part actually means that worker processes are created in advance, so that time is not wasted forking only when a worker is needed</p> <hr /> <p>A very commonly used combo includes Nginx + Gunicorn + Django where Gunicorn acts as a middleware between nginx and the Django</p> <p><img src="https://rukbottoland.com/media/images/arquitectura-django-gunicorn-nginx-supervisor.jpg" alt="img" /></p> <p>But now with Gunicorn why the hell do we need Nginx… seems unnecessary to me</p> <p>Well with Gunicorn Ngnix acts as a reverse proxy server which can be used to provide load balancing, provide web acceleration through caching or compressing inbound and outbound data, and provide an extra layer of security by intercepting requests headed for back-end servers and also gunicorn is designed to be an application server that sits behind a reverse proxy server that handles load balancing, caching, and preventing direct access to internal resources.</p> <p>Actually python comes with it’s own built-in web server that provides standard GET and HEAD request handlers. You can use this to turn any directory in your system into your web server directory. I have actually used this to share code and stuff with my peers and it’s pretty handy &lt;3</p> <p>Now to reaffirm the fact that i have learnt somethings let’s write sum fresh code with Sockets… ughh…Now I’m glad I don’t have to do this everytime I write a webapp</p> <p>Now let’s run this code to start a simple web server on port 8000</p> <div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>import socket

we pass in the "level" SOL_SOCKET and the value we want it set to.
