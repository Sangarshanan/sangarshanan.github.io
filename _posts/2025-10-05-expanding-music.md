We were having a discussion about music recommendation systems in class recently and there is a popular opinion that all these algorithms create echo chambers and don't help us broaden our knowledge and interests in new ideas, arts, genres.

The things we get through the internet, not just music, even clothes & opinions that are a result of an "algorithm" without putting in work to go out, talk, research have inherently less value to us. 

Value comes from effort. Algorithms run at scale by big corporations will inherently always be attention-grabbing and capitalistic because big record labels, with greater resources, can afford to promote their artists. Expanding your taste means sitting with an uncomfortable song for a few minutes. It's so easy to skip for me because my attention span sucks, so I came up with some ideas that have worked a little and helped me discover newer/better music:

- Recommendation algorithms push you a song. When you like a song, listen to the album, top to bottom. Listening to one song from an album gives a piece of story that you enjoy, but there is a whole lot of context you missed by skipping to the next similar song, which is part of a different story with a similar idea! 
> Chase stories rather than a collection of ideas.
- Go to record stores, open mics and jams, meet new artists, always pass the aux & listen to others' playlists.
- Shazam it to hell! Whenever I hear music I like while walking around the city, caf√©s, malls, I Shazam it, listen to the album.


I have discovered great artists through algorithms, they don't suck. But without putting in a conscious effort it will always end up keeping you safe in the bubble of saturated art.

Art needs space to breathe, to fail, to experiment, to augment! We need to be OK with it and encourage it to truly create something of value! Leave the regurgitated formulaic shit to AI and pop artists.
