When I was in college I wanted to work on everything I considered to be cool, I didn't spend time learning and just started jumping into projects half assed and just worked on it enough to make it work. I wrote shit code that just worked, Totally unreadable, Silly shortcuts, embarrassing mistakes and man shouls I even start about reproducibility. One of my projects used to only work on a full moon from 12 - 2AM when the demons could hear compilation   

I'm not in college anymore and more recently I've started writing code that is going into production and is critical so I can't afford to write code that "just works". It's also high time I learn to write code I can shed happy tears about. I figured the best way to do that is to start my pilgrimage towards to open source gods. Looking at some of the code written on amazing open source projects opened a million doors 

So I am going to track my Open source Journey here, ** Fortunate son Plays in the background **


### March 2019 (YellowBrick)

My very first Open source contribution was made by following the big Gsoc hype. I thought that contributing can lead way to Gsoc which never happened and I kinda lost track being lazy :( I had never used yellowbrick before but it turned to be quite useful so I decided to contribute a simple example (That was my NLP Phase)

https://github.com/DistrictDataLabs/yellowbrick#yellowbrick-datasets

Was kinda scared at first but the maintainers were really appreciative and amazing that I ended up writing a blog about it too https://www.districtdatalabs.com/rapid-text-visualization-with-yellowbrick 


### November 2019 (PyPa Packaging)

Ok so this was pretty big for me since I felt confident enough to move from contributing documentation to actual code, well github action but still counts  

https://github.com/pypa/packaging/pull/243

But this was quite a controversial PR as there was an issue with coverage and underlying systems discovered later and fixed https://github.com/pypa/packaging/issues/246, https://github.com/pypa/packaging/pull/249 

But it felt amazing to contribute to pypa cause I fanboy over Brett Cannon (https://snarky.ca/ ) and Dustin Ingram (The million amazing Pycon talks)
