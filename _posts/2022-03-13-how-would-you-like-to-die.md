Birds, oh the sound of birds chirping on, I don't know how but they somehow make me breathe easy so I take a deep breath and inadvertently let out a big smile as I walked aimlessly into the forest. I come here everyday after work, just walking aimlessly and choosing a new deviation in the trail everyday so its not just a mundane hike. It doesn't matter which path I take though cause its all been laid out by the shepherds living in these mountains to reach the grassland on the top, but just up ahead there is a huge rock pointing outward into the valley. 

That is my spot.

I come here everyday to check on Dai, Everyone in the village seem to hate the old man but he does not mind. He comes into the village rarely so I just come here to see him at his spot. He likes me, I think, cause he is the only person who talks to me like I am real. People back in town think I am stupid, even my own mom, I don't think I am stupid, I just find it very hard to explain why I am not because I cannot speak very well and maybe that is because i cannot hear very well too, mom  tells me its connected. I come here to see Dai cause he tells me stories about the mountains and i just like to listen to him. people say he doesn't talk so my friend doran would not believe me when i tell him the stories Dai tells me, he thinks I make them up. people also says Dai is weird and that I should stay away from him

I sat at the spot and waited for Dai to come, this is where we always meet. The last time Dai told me about his big palace at the top of the peak, He used to stay there with his queen and his prince. The prince is the funniest guy ever and Dai always had to help him out as he gets into the most absurd tangles, he once got his hair stuck on a thorn in the garden and just did not move for a three hours without calling for help and fell asleep before Dai discovered him, I chuckle as i think about it now, So one day there was a fight between the Dai and the Demons living in the sky and they stole the prince from Dai, That made me a little sad

But not to worry Dai told me he is going to Sky to see his prince and has prepared some harshly worded questions for the demons in the Sky who stole him. I hope the demons are reasonable and listen to Dai.

I come here everyday to check on Dai, This is his spot and I am just keeping it for him. Its been twelve years in Earth time but for the sky demons its very different, that is what Dai always said.

I remember as I look up at the sky and smile
