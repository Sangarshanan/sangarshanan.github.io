I just recently came across the Magnificent [Inspirobot](http://inspirobot.me/) It is a treasure trove of absurd motivational quotes on top of equally absurd backgrounds. I spent too much time clicking and generating quotes which is sometimes thought provoking and a lof of times evoke existential dread.

> **Randomness can sometimes be absolutely hilarious - Someone Famous**

I really wanted to do something similar so I took two things I find hilarious and mushed em all up. **Dank Memes + Quotes from Kanye West**


I used two different APIs to do this. [Memegen](https://github.com/jacebrowning/memegen) and [Kanye.Rest](https://kanye.rest/)


Memegen allows you to programmatically generate memes whereas Kanye.rest provides Kanye as a service by giving us random quotes.


Combining these we have an API that randomly generates Kanye memes

It's up on <https://kanye-meme-generator.netlify.app> and here is the [code](https://github.com/Sangarshanan/ye-meme-generator)
