2019 was an amazing year for me 

- I graduated this year from VIT 
- I got a job I love at Grofers and I work with really amazing people 
- I got to travel to US and talk at a Pygotham, my first ever python conference and met some of the best people there
- Minecraft finally got the clout it deserved


Getting involved with the python community was something that I always wanted to do and I had just figured out that I could submit talk proposals to conferences and with the right effort and timing I could travel with financial aid to attend these conferences, meet a bunch of really cool people and just hang around and explore the city for a few days. Truth be told I never really expected anything to come out of the talk proposals I kept submitting to all the conferences that could be found online since I had just graduated, not given previous talks at conferences and was clearly not an expert in anything. As the lore goes my financial aid got accepted by pygotham, a NYC based python conference and I was one of their backup speakers but then I guess I just got really lucky as one of the speakers dropped out of a Pygotham and I was offered a spot on the schedule to talk and also I was getting financial aid... I had not applied for VISA and applied hastily but with some help from my dad's acquaintance who worked in the US embassy I ended up with a VISA just a few weeks before the conference. It still feels surreal how all this happened so fast. So yeah ... that is how I travelled to NYC to speak at Pygotham my first ever conference talk and it ended up being one of the best experiences of my life.

## My First day in NYC: 

So the conference was on the 4th and 5th of october and my talk was on the 5th. I landed in NYC on 3rd october 7 AM after a 15 hour flight and my eyelids lost control cause of severe jetlaggery but all that disappered when I stepped out the airport and into NYC not cause I was excited or anything but cause mann it was sooo cold. It was also raining the day I landed ... severe bummer :(  

Ah the Day I landed in America, I started missing the *metric system* terribly

I took the airtrain to jamaica and then the LIRR to Penn station as Pygotham had booked me rooms in hotel Pennsylvania (It was like right opposite Madison Square garden and in front of the Empire state.. OH MY GOD)

Since I could only check into the hotel at 3:00 PM I had to request the concierge to hold on to my humongous hiking bag while I left to look around and get it all in. I was actually a little hungry so decided to grab a pizza at a diner nearby...it was right next to Hotel Penn. It was called Little Italy, the red one you see in the pic below. Two cheese pizza slices and a dr peppers ... but the pizza was actually not good :( why do movies set such high standards for New York pizzas ? maybe I should have gone to the right place.

( Ok so a few later I ate the famed dollar slize pizzas near grand central and those were like the BEST I take everything back)

So after wasting few hours waiting for the rain to die, I quickly bought and Umbrella at the local CVS and started exploring the city with 0 idea where I was going. I had a rough idea of all the places I wanted to visit but did not know how to visit them or the order I should visit them in. I though I would just go check out manhattan mall as it was quite nearby. Did a bit of window shopping by converting the price of every item from $ to â‚¹

Now the rain had subsided so I started walking around manhattan taking random pictures of stuff with the new DSLR I had bought just for this trip
