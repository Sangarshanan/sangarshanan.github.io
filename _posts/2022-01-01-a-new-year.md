'Tis 2022

2021 forced me to get older, the quarter life crisis which hits everyone a bit later, hit us early
cause of the pandemic. I was forced out of my comfort zone and found some comfort blindly venturing into the oblivion.  This was a year of Adventure & Heartbreaks. 

##### Did my First Recurse Mini Batch

#### Spent 3 months in Himachal, livin, Oh I was livin

#### Trekked Triund & Kudremukh

#### Got my heart broken

#### Music became a big part of my life

#### Bought a Kindle & Started Reading

#### Rented my own place in Bangalore in Langford Gardens

#### Went to my first concert alone, Saw Peter cat live @ UB city

#### Started going on Runs at the park


Dharamkot was magical: The people, The perspective, The pahad. I want to travel to more magical places but I know I have to establish a discipline for myself before, I want to do so many things and the chaos of travelling is not ideal to achieve my goals so I got my own place in Bangalore hoping it helps ground myself to actually put in the work

2021 showed me the life I could have outside of work and this actually made my life at work a bit shit, It got to a point where I started feeling disconnected with my job and my coworkers, I am still working on getting that balance right cause I honestly like the people I work with and the culture they bring in.

I do not promise yet hope 

- You get better at music and start making dope shit, Guitar, Flute & Generative
- You finally start putting out content you wanted to since college, it's time to share your cringe with the world 
- You Travel, anywhere, go somewhere scary
- Put yourself out here like you did with the peter cat concert, Go live a little
- I hope you are better equipped to deal with heartbreaks, I hope you don't shut yourself off or fall into negative loops again
- You have a few really good friends, Do not fucking let them go ! HOLD ON TO THEM.
- RUN ! get better at running, maybe start cycling ? I dunno but sweat it out every now and then
- Talk to your MOM and DAD often tell them you love them cause they are your only source of unconditional love
- Just exist: Breathe, Meditate, Walk around in Nature, maybe do vipassana 
- read books ! cut down on your phone time & social media dude
- The years flow fast so stop worrying too much

All the best Sangachan your past version is rooting for you...
