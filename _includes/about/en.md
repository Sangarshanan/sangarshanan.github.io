Hey there, This is my very own personal memoir kinda thing for me to look back to. I will document the stuff I learnt, did and enjoyed. Be prepared for selective musings with doses of cringe.

I am Sangarshanan, I am 21 years old. I love Memes, Computers, Music, Netflix and pretending to like popular culture to seem cool.

As a kid I liked physics, history and computers. I owe my love for physics to all the amazing tv shows like Into the Universe and Cosmos. I should thank my dad for history lessons he used to give cause his knowledge and passion for it are contagious and honestly the stories are fun too and obviously I loved computers cause it has been my friend my whole life, mostly cause of all the after-school game nights ;)

Both my parents have a degree in computer science and maybe we are bound to the subject forever. I enjoy writing code and planning cool imaginary projects in my head. I also recently started getting into Open source and hoping to make my way into the community through contributions. I like to think I can be funny and recently my stupid mind has asked me try out stand-up as a hobby but have not given it a real try cause I am kinda scared. I make memes and ran a page into the ground cause it got "too dark". I love talking on stage cause we all need some attention to survive, I though conferences would be good place to do em make some friends and learn along the way so started applying/ talking at them. 

I like to imagine myself living / working in different places around the world, making friends and talking with people from different backgrounds. I wanna keep learning, keep making memes, keep trying stuff that scares me and wanna have fun doing them.

I currently work at Grofers on data problems, mainly with geospatial data !

    TL;DR You don't have to, I have always been ok with people using nicknames to save time, even my parents don't call me sangarshanan so its totally fine, but if you insist (Phonetically)

<h4> SUN - GHAR - SHUN - NUN </h4>

I have not been given a second name, I use my dad's name (Veera) as my surname. There is a very interesting reason for this, if you are curious check out <https://medium.com/lessons-from-history/why-dont-tamil-people-have-last-names-e68327e9444c>
