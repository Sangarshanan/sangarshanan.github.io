Everyone listens to music, its fun soothing and honestly makes me wanna not kill myself when travelling. its always fun to share the music you love with other people, I've always found that it's an excellent icebreaker and a way to bond. But there is always this mental barrier.. What if my music is not cool enough ? or worse it what if the other person likes nickelback. 

Back in college manliness was measured by the number of experimental prog metal bands you can name and you can only listen to clairo alone with noice cancelling headphones cause you dont want the guys to discover that you could be a pretty girl. Maybe your whole personality revolves around the fact that you love death grips and you literally cannot and will not let anything else define you as a person cause being different is the only thing that will fill the void your unhappy childhood left in your soul. I apologize for the above statements, Now I am trying to fill in words so that this paragraph looks symmetric on the website.

Alright, getting back here's part 1 of my favorite music (April 2020: Midst the corona pandemic)


I started listening to Midnight when the whole vaporwave 80s retro movement started, I think it was around 2016 when I stumbled upon Los Angeles & Days of Thunder. It was love then and now. My favorite song by The Midnight is Sunset from Endless Summer. I also love Vampires and Jason from Endless summer. Almost all the songs have this vibe that just make me feel good.

Recently Weeknd's Blinding lights single gave out a similar vibe and oh boy I think synthwave seems to be making its way to the mainstream and I couldn't be happier. Since I mentioned the Weeknd I would also like to acknowledge my love for Abel.

I still remember the first time I heard Lana Del Rey. I was watching The Great Gatsby when Young and Beautiful started playing. I remember immediately picking up my phone to look for the artist. Her iconic Voice makes every song sound epic. Born to die, Paradise, ultraviolence, Lust for life and Norman fucking rockwell. I stan everything this queen does
