Breakpoint is the part where you intentionally stop or pause your program to debug and to evaluate, Programs are not the only things riddled with bugs and in need of constant evaluation and debugging, we have breakpoints in life as well

I have been living & working from the Mountains for more than a month now, I came to Dharamkot on April 11th 2021 and today is May 22nd. I think I can say with confidence that I am not the same person I was when I came here, I came here just wanting to chill and this place ended up changing me in so many different ways.

I spent most of 2020 in a single room. I code. I eat. I shit. I sleep but I love writing code, I just kept doing it and it gave me purpose. I made up challenges for myself, problems to solve, things to learn and stuff to build. I focussed on work and worked weekdays and weekends alike. I wasn't sad at all, I just wasn't feeling anything. Towards the end of March cases in India seemed to drop which in hindsight was a huge omen so I decided to have a change to scenery and head to Dharamshala

And thank fucking god I did !

I will never forget this place, Why would I ? The people I am with and the people I meet every single day are magnificent in so many ways and teach me so many things from the simplest of gestures to hard compelling truths of life.

I no longer just code. I write. I sing. I play the flute. I run. I walk. I listen to the birds. I meditate. I listen to myself

I am debugging myself

This is my breakpoint...
