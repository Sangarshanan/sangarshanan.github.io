Chromatic scale is a set of twelve pitches/ notes separated by the interval of a semitone

```math
C  C#(Db)  D   D#(Eb)  E   F   F#(Gb)  G   G#(Ab)  A   A#(Bb)  B
```

There are various types of relationships that occur between these keys. The circle of fifths is usually used to provide a **visual representation of these relationships.**

The circle gets its name from the fact that as we move clockwise we add to the circle an **Interval of 5** which can also be represented as **7 semitones** So as we start with **C** and work our way clockwise to the next note which is **G** after crossing `1 c# 2 D 3 D# 4 E 5 F 6 F#` and so if C is chosen as a starting point the sequence is: `C, G, D, A, E, B (=C♭), F♯ (=G♭), C♯ (=D♭), A♭, E♭, B♭, F.` Continuing the pattern from F returns the sequence to its starting point of C.

What we see in the circle could represent either **Notes** or **Chords** or **Keys**

**As Notes**

- Figuring out chords: When you are trying to figure out a C chord you know it's C - - the second note is E cause its two intervals away from C but the third note is too long from C but with a lil visual help from the circle of fifths we can just jump onto G and figure out the chords mucho rápido
