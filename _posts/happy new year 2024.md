Welcome to 2024

this uncle is gonna turn 26 this year

i did a roadtrip across 4 states in the USA with Shrey and Maahi for Pycon US, it
was amazing cause everything went wrong but we had fun, finally learnt to change a tyre 
i went to Prague and made some great friends, Joseph from US who i met in prague even visited me in bangalore and stayed for a few days!

You are "not bad" at Sonic Pi and maybe you will get to showcase your set at the next Algorave. Keep doing music! get better and it will be more fun

Been a year since i switched to beatoven and moved into Prestige Falcon city, made a friends group here and we hang out every now and then

i like beatoven, work is very chill & i get the time and energy to work on a lot of cool stuff but still sometimes i think of getting a gig in Europe, lets see what happens i am still in limbo

Climbed Chandrashila in winter! saw my first full fledged snowfall and made two crazy guys who were open to side quests after a whole day of trekking

went to himachal a whole bunch, visited dhmkt again but also kareri and kalga this time!

also explored a lot of Kodai finally! went to poombarai, kookal and poondi.

When i look back at a lot of my memories it doesnt seem real, i am grateful to have had moments like that and to share it with beautiful souls
