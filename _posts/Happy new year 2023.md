It is 2023 now

Fuck i am getting old man, this year i will turn 25 in october, no more early twenties, goddamn

this year was nice too

I realized I cannot stop traveling but longer trips are hard, dharamkot was a one off rare thing and the people will always be in and around. traveling puts my life to pause and i need to move ahead there too

I traveled to SFO and SLC for Pycon and Dublin for EuroPython this year, I also went to Buran Ghati and understood how relationships are supposed to feel like

Quit my gig at Blinkit and joined Beatoven.ai a generative music startup, it came with a paycut but less tension and more passionate people around who also happen to be music nerds

Took up a new place finally on the 22nd floor gated society, tis a good life, your balcony has killer views and you have an amazing cook, I am also going to the gym regularly now and sometime i swim, do sauna, play badminton and stuff, the society is also a nice place to walk around. maintained lawns and fountains. it was my childhood dream to live in a place like this, 24 years later i am here.

this year i want you to focus on your creative pursuits, figure out how your career is gonna pan out cause you are already a senior engineer now! 

after volunteering at conferences i have started to wonder is devrel is a good career switch to make ? not sure now but lets see how it goes at beatoven

i hope you hone your creative crafts, write more, play the flute, pick up your dusty guitar, start making sets on sonic pi, perform a comedy set finally after 200 years of whining

good luck
