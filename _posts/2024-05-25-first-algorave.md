[Algorave](https://lu.ma/kmyc4sxp) is happening in home turf again and this time i am gonna head out to perform! For the first time as [roguentropy](https://www.instagram.com/roguentropy) :)

I am obviously nervous but so happy & grateful cause after consistently pushing out content on my page for around a year, I will finally get to do a full fledged 30 minute set in front of people and its also gonna be streamed on <https://eulerroom.com/>

May all ears emerge unscathed this evening! Or will they?
