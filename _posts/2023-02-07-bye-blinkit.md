When I was at the summit of Chandrashila someone told me that our trek photographer had broke down crying cause this was
the first time in two years he was able to get a clear view of Nanda Devi, we summited on a perfect day and it just happened to be my first time, On the second day of the trek it snowed, the whole way through! I was secretly praying for snow on the first day but turns out the second day is of meadows and forests so we saw magic unfold as snow-covered oak trees and meadows turned into white blankets! It just happened to be the perfect day for snow.

As I stood here on the edge of the valley looking at the most beautiful sunset of my life, I whispered 'Thank you' to the mountains and I heard it back.

...

Today is my last day at Blinkit, it was not an easy choice to make cause the people i got to work with here were the best but i did not feel like i was doing what i am meant to do right now ! not that i know all the time what i am supposed to be but this time i knew i had to go. it was fun while it lasted and it gave me the learning of a lifetime and mentors whose words i will carry for a very long time

...

I am gonna be join beatoven.ai as a Backend engineer, covid got me hooked on music and it has been a big part of my life since then. now my work is also gonna be to help brilliant folks generate incredible music! i will get to work with creative engineers and musicians, oftentimes both! Creative pursuits always are fun and all i want out of life is to have fun because what else is there?
