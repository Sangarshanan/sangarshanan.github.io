Duh Doy: <https://github.com/Sangarshanan/duhdoy>

There are several ways to spend a weekend, I don't understand why I choose to do stupid shit like this.

duhdoy is a package that prints text sArCaStiCalLy for you, this is essentially what happen when jokes have too many layers of irony, it ends up being represented by randomized letter cases

Just `pip install duhdoy` and start `duhdoy.print("I am loving every second of this")`

That is it. 

Here is a unfunny spongebob meme incase you are 12 years old

Also the package name is a not so subtle community reference, a glimmer of hope during these dark ages.
