Hi, My name is Sangarshanan  (I can't prononce it either)

I like doing cool shit with my computer, staring into the void, talking about space and making dank memes 

I studied computer science and graduated from VIT vellore in 2019. I currently work at grofers on data stuff. 

I tend to forget stuff to I though it would be fun to write it down for the me in the future 

Wow, you read the whole thing huh...... Thanks...I guess
