We started out with the "first stay stuff" which included a Welcome session and meets & greets. Timezones are weird cause the first day started at 9 PM which is more like the end of the day. At the ceremonial first day sessions I got to understand what RC is about, the [4 social rules](https://www.recurse.com/social-rules), software tour and talked to a bunch of new peeps in the zoom chat roulette. I will never not be traumatized after being yanked out of breakrooms in between sente

I also attended the Databases Study Group where they were discussing Designing Data-Intensive Applications but they had already gone past to the second chapter :( but someone from the new batch asked us if we could start a catch up group and discuss from the beginning. I hope we do that, I've wanted to read this book for a really long time but been too lazy about it but with a group to study with I might finally get my act together so ðŸ¤ž

### DONE:

- Wanted to learn some Functional programming so start with some exercises on Codewars <https://github.com/Sangarshanan/codewars>

- Studied like two pages of DDIA

- Some research on Jupyter services like <https://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/services.html> to see if I could structure my dashboarding tool as a service

**Overall**: Not a lot done but had hella fun

### TODO:

- Continue work on Jupyter dashboarding and push for a basic MVC

- Listen to the pairing and coffee bot ( People over Projects !! )

- Apply to the Non technical Talk

- Book office hours with Recurse Faculty and say Hi !

- Make an RC bot ? maybe a game or an animation ?

- Take a look at SICP <https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/full-text/book/book.html>

That is a lot for a week I know ! but technically I never graduate

Toodles :wq
