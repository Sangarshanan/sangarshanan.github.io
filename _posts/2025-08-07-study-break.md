So it's been 6 years since I was last a student and just thinking about this feels weird because I am a completely different person now. A combination of life events fuelled by the pandemic got me into doing absurd/cool things. I traveled a ton, shed some of my insecurities, worked a lot on my anxieties, social skills, and learnt to love. Looking back at my student life, I feel like looking back at a very different person.

Working all these years was so important because I needed this time to learn and grow as a person, but in this journey I stumbled into music and realised I want it to be a very important part of my life. After a fun 2.5-year stint at beatoven.ai, I realised I wanted to do more music but somehow always end up de-prioritising my personal goals. I end up starting a hundred things and finishing only a handful. The accumulating backlog of personal goals just started getting to me after a while. I somehow felt like I could never do this without taking a hit on my work life or social life. I needed time to study and create!

> I want to be a student again.

I am heading to Barcelona in September to do my master's in Sound and Music Computing at UPF. This decision somehow just felt like the natural trajectory that my life is supposed to take, and for the first time I will be studying something I actually know quite a lot about + I already have work experience in! So this is me deciding to prioritise my personal goals, learning, building and meeting people who align a lot with those goals before restarting my work life.

Very excited <3
