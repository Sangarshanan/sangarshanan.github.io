I love gaming, I always have. It has been my escape since I was a little boy and it is also what got me interested in computers in the first place. I have been playing around with Pygame for the past week now and finally decided its time for a commitment so I made my first game !!

It is just a generic space shooter and I named it vimana in accordance to my efforts to adding a bit of a desi flavor to my projects cause why not ! We have some of the coolest mythologies.

TLDR; I made a game where you can basically just move around with arrow keys and use space to shoot shit and get points. 

I have also added builds for Windows and Linux (Mac users can either install pygame or piss off)
