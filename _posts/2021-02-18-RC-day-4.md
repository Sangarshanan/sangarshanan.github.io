## Work Work and more Work but the fun kind

- Worked on my Query parser to get it to a Demo"able" state for the presentations tomorrow
- Meet & Greets i.e The Good 'ol Zoom chat Roulette. Met a couple of new people

Attended the Type Theory Study Group. I know jackshit about Type theory but I do wanna learn functional programming and those concepts are somehow intertwined so I just took notes hoping the future type theory understanding me can decipher it                                                                                                                                                            
- Idris: very strong types, claims no need tests ?      
- z3 (encoding puzzles)       
- Types can help reduce errors
- PLFA Agda (<https://plfa.github.io/>) 
- Proposotions as types <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOiZatlZtGU>
- TypedHoles are cool <https://youtu.be/0oo8wIi2qBE>

Whole lotta Zoom 

- The Ever amusing coffee klatsch with Meta zoom backgrounds
- Also talked with Shivam, he mentioned Formal methods, static analysis and also drew                                           
parallels between static & dynamic systems in CS and Physics
- Had a Coffee chat with Robert where we talked about the projects we are working on and how lazy the western Mosquitoes are
- Did an Early Morning half asleep race against time to Push out the RC map. Will work on making it more presentable tomorrow 

Tomorrow is my last `T-1` day so I am pretty bummed about it but I am also sorta relieved that I can move back to a less intense sleep schedule from Monday.

Will write about my last day or as the cool people call it "Return statement" tomorrow.
