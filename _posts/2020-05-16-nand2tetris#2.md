We ended part 1 with the building out the hardware for our computer and also managed to write a low level language that can run instructions on top the our hardware, Now we move on to ze software (YAY) we start with the overview 

- Think of something cool 
- We write a program in a high level language 
- Compiler compiles high level code to an intermediatory VM code
- VM translator converts it to assembly code 
- Yoo now we can run this on our hardware

We missed the OS, this is gonna be used by our high level lang for doing stuff like graphics, IO from files, reading keyboard input, Storing objects, threads and so much more that we as programmers dont have to worry about... mostly
