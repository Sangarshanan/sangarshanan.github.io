> Nostalgia is truly one of the great human weaknesses...second only to the neck. 

Hey there, This is my very own personal memoir kinda thing for me to look back to. I will document the stuff I learnt, did and enjoyed. Be prepared for selective musings with doses of cringe.

As a kid I liked physics, music, history and computers. I owe my love for physics to all the amazing tv shows like Into the Universe and Cosmos. I should thank my dad for history lessons he used to give cause his knowledge and passion for it are contagious and honestly the stories are fun too and obviously I loved computers cause it has been my friend my whole life, mostly cause of all the after-school game nights. I got into music because of some amazing musicians I met and befriended in the Mountains, Hoping to get better at it /

I like to think I can be funny cause my stupid mind loves coming up with absurd bits with random set-ups. I also make memes and ran a page into the ground cause it got "too dark". I also love talking on stage cause attention is my poison of choice.

I like to imagine myself living in different places around the world, making friends, enjoying music, I wanna keep learning, write more jokes, get into music and just keep trying more stuff that scares me while having fun doing it.

I currently work at Grofers on data problems !
