I have been studying AI since 2016, my second year at Uni and working in the AI industry since 2023. I love it! and it's been a lot of fun integrating it into my daily workflows, I believe that this has a lot of potential to be a net positive change in this world.

BUT

### The joy of building

I built this game <https://keep-walking-seven.vercel.app/> in a couple hours, i wanted to make something like this back in college and toiled for hours learning about different methods, techniques, algorithms that took me to random tangents! I ended up doing something else entirely but that does not happen anymore, I don't need to scurry across the internet looking for inspirations anymore, I rarely go off on tangents while working on personal projects, Maybe that is a good thing but I always derived joy from venturing into unexpected places and stumbling into something random and amazing! This is kinda like what e-commerce has done to shopping, people used to attached to their clothing cause there was a story tied to how you bought it, the anticipation, the various shops that had nothing your taste and finally you look at that dress, the one you knew you wanted but could not explain, Building projects are like that for me, poetic. That is slowly going away
