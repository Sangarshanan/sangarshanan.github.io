So I once again heard American Boy by Estelle ft Kanye West in some stupid Tiktok and got hooked to the beats once more but this time being an adult and all I carefully analyzed the lyrics and found something very interesting

In Chorus 1 Estelle Sings

```math
Take me on a trip, I'd like to go some day
Take me to New York, I'd love to see LA
```

Do you see it ?

LA is nowhere near New York !! They are apart by 3000 miles in American ðŸ¤¢ or 4800 kilometers in Human

So why did Estelle Say **Take me to New York, I'd love to see LA**

It would have sense if she said 

**Take me to New York, I'd love to see <The Empire State/ Literally anything in NY >**

I would have even understood if she said 

**Take me to New York, I'd love to not be able to afford an apartment**

But why did Estelle Say LA ? 

Why does she want Kanye to take her to New York even though she really wants to see LA ? 

Is this a meta commentary on our sociopolitical situation ?

Is this a subtle metaphor for Cognitive dissonance ? 

Is she trolling us ? 

What is the point ? 

### EDIT:

oh nevermind y'all I figured it out, She did it because it rhymes with the rest of the chorus ðŸ˜©

So she Rhymes **Day** with **LA**

```math
Take me on a trip, I'd like to go some day
Take me to New York, I'd love to see LA
```

That is not a very good Rhyme now is it ?

Well even then it would have made sense to go with **Bay** cause it rhymes better with Day and NYC is literally a bay
so maybe along these lines and there is an Upper Bay

```math
Take me to New York, I'd love to see Upper Bay
It is owned by Private Equity Firms
They are a bunch of filthy worms
I'm likin' this American boy, American boy
```
