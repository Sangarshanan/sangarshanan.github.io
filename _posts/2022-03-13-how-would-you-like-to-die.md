Birds, oh the sound of birds chirping on, I don't know how but they somehow make me feel warm inside and I inadvertently let out a big smile as I walked aimlessly into the forest. I have been doing this a lot after work nowadays, just walking aimlessly and choosing a new deviation in the trail everyday so its not just a mundane hike. It doesn't matter which path I take though cause its all been laid out by the shepherds living in these mountains to reach the village on the top, but just before you see hints of civilization there is a huge rock pointing outward into the valley. 

That is my spot.

I sit there almost everyday now and just look at the sky change colors and the sun slowly vanish as darkness consumes the valley. I pick the same safer trail back home.

Walking down, I realise how empty my mind is, I cant seem to think of anything and my whole body is just focused on what is ahead. I had to switch on my torch as it was getting a bit dark and the trail is a bit rocky downhill. I reached the huge tree that forms an arch shaped structure with its branches as the path takes a steep downhill bend, I consider this a sorta of a halfway point, this is usually where I sit down to write but today I see someone else there which is weird cause this trail is only used by the locals and most of them should already be home by now. 

This person seemed to be wearing a dark long dress or maybe it just looks dark from here I could not tell, I see the shadow of their long curly hair flowing in the direction of the wind as they looked up at me. As walk down towards the shadow I realised it was saavu.
