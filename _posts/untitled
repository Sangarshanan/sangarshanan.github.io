When i was at the summit of Chandrashila someone told me that our trek photographer had broke down crying cause this was
the first time in two years he was able to get a clear view of Nanda Devi, we summitted on the perfect day and it just happened to be my first time, On the second day of the trek it snowed, the whole way through ! I was secretly praying for snow on the first day but turns out second day is of meadows and forests so we saw magic unfold as snow covered oak trees and meadows turned into white blankets ! It just happened to be the perfect day for snow.

As i stood here on the edge of the valley looking at the most beautiful sunset of my life, I whispered 'Thank you' to mountains and i think i heard it back.
