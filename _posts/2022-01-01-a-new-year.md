'Tis 2022

2021 forced me to get older, the quarter life crisis which hits everyone a bit later, hit us early
cause of the pandemic. I was forced out of my comfort zone and found some comfort blindly venturing into the oblivion.

- Did my First Recurse Mini Batch

- Built a database in Python

- Geopatra functionalities finally moved inside Geopandas, worked on that

- Spent 3 months in Himachal, livin, Oh I was livin

- Read some Philosophy books + Started questioning + broke down some my conditioning 

- Trekked Triund & Kudremukh

- Realised I actually fucking love walking around nature

- Music became a big part of my life

- Bought a Kindle & Started Reading

- Rented my own place in Bangalore, I can walk to Cubbon park now

- Went to my first concert alone, Saw Peter cat live @ UB city

- Started going on Runs at the park, to increase my endurance


I have to establish a discipline for myself this year, I want to do so many things but the chaos of my mind & shitty attention span keeps pushing me into these loops that end up nowhere, now I got my own place/space in Bangalore hoping it helps ground myself to actually put in the work, put in the hours & take what's hours

2021 showed me the life I could have outside of work and this actually made my life at work a bit shit, It got to a point where I started feeling disconnected with my job and my coworkers, I am still working on getting that balance right cause I honestly like the people I work with and the culture they bring in but I also want to do soo much outside work.

I do not promise yet hope 

- You get better at music and start making dope shit, Guitar, Flute & Generative
- You finally start putting out content you wanted to since college, it's time to share your cringe with the world
- Cook maybe ? get better at it & Cook for your mom
- You Travel, anywhere, go somewhere scary
- Put yourself out here like you did with the peter cat concert, Go live a little
- I hope you are better equipped to deal with heartbreaks, I hope you don't shut yourself off or fall into negative loops again
- You have a few really good friends, Do not fucking let them go ! HOLD ON TO THEM.
- RUN ! get better at running, maybe start cycling ? I dunno but sweat it out every now and then
- Talk to your MOM and DAD often tell them you love them cause they are your only source of unconditional love
- Just exist: Breathe, Meditate, Walk around in Nature, maybe do vipassana 
- read books ! cut down on your phone time & social media dude
- The years flow fast so stop worrying too much

All the best Sangachan your past version is rooting for you...
