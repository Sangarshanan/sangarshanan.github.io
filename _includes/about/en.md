> Nostalgia is truly one of the great human weaknesses...second only to the neck. 

Hey there, This is my very own personal memoir kinda thing for me to look back to. I will document the stuff I learnt, did and enjoyed. Be prepared for selective musings with doses of cringe.

I am Sangarshanan, I am 21 years old. I love Memes, Computers, Music, Netflix and pretending to like popular culture to seem cool.

As a kid I liked physics, history and computers. I owe my love for physics to all the amazing tv shows like Into the Universe and Cosmos. I should thank my dad for history lessons he used to give cause honestly his knowledge and passion for it are contagious and honestly the stories are fun too and obviously I loved computers for the games well atleast that is how it started. 

Both my parents have a degree in computer science and maybe we are bound to the subject forever. I enjoy writing code (except javascript) and planning cool imaginary projects in my head. I also recently started getting into Open source and hoping to make my way into the community through contributions. I like to think I can be funny and recently my stupid mind has asked me try out stand-up as a hobby but have not given it a real try cause I am kinda scared. I make memes and ran a page pretty well before it got "too real" for the people. I love talking on stage cause we all need some attention to survive, I though conferences would be good place to do em make some friends and learn along the way so started applying/ talking at them. 

I like to imagine myself living and working in different places around the world, interacting with different cultures. I wanna keep learning, keep making memes, keep trying stuff that scares me and wanna have fun doing them.

I currently work at Grofers on data problems, mainly with geospatial data !
