oofÃ© tis finally 2021


Well first off acknowledging privilege, I am lucky to have practically chilled through this whole
ordeal while shit was getting crazier and crazier out there. I finna wanted to travel to attend conferences
this year cause Pygotham 2019 was a real hoot but twas the magic of 2020, everything was now online. The year sucked but I am very much lucky and grateful to be where I am today 

So with the online format, Pygotham did something cool, they decided to brand the conf like a TV show 
and I thought this would be the perfect opportunity to try and be funny. I submitted my talk 
on ensembling models <https://2020.pygotham.tv/talks/two-is-better-than-one-a-segment-on-ensembling-models/> 
and it was accepted ! I decided to adapt my talk to a Late night format, mostly inspired from 
Last Week Tonight and started writing jokes and boy was it hard and fun at the same time.

I have always had this obsession to be the funniest person in the room to a point where I try really hard to manufacture jokes 
out of thin air. The first time I tried to be funny in public was my first year in college, we had
a course called English for Engineers and the goal of the final project was to prepare and deliver a monologues, I just copied 
jokes from the sets of other comedians and did like an ensemble set of stolen jokes but here's the thing, It Worked !!! people 
responded really really well and I was pumping with adrenaline by the end of it and wanted to keep going forever, That was also 
the time where I decided I wanna do this more often cause it is exhilarating but I am also a lazy mf so I did not do anything 
about it.

PygothamTV was a chance for me to do it again, the two things I loved, computers and comedy. It was really fun and
there was a point I was doubting every bit I wrote but I had a second set of eyes and reassurance from some wonderful friends. 
So yeah I finally recorded myself, twice actually cause I fricked up the audio the first time around
