I am Sangarshanan and it's August 28, 2021

Time flows and I continue to evolve. The past couple of months was filled with New people, New places and New experiences courtesy of the Himalayas. I learnt a lot of things about myself and about the world, actually it was more relearning cause I broke down my Conditioning in a lot of ways and that gave me newfound perspective.

Often enough I feel myself giving into my emotions in situations that seem absurd in hindsight, I feel lost and the rational thinking part of my brain goes on a brief detour. I feel like this is because I don't give myself time to process because the world has enough distractions to keep any sentient being occupied for centuries

Boredom is a natural feeling and it forces you to introspect but my mind hates it and wants to intoxicate itself, I want to fight that urge without giving into boredom. I wanna be bored again

This is where Meditation helps, I am not good at it but I hope to be one day. Speaking of, a really good friend of mine actually lent me a book called Meditations, it's not your everyday book so you have to be in a different zone to read and actually process it. It has made me pick up some practical stoic principles.

Whenever I feel my mind wanders in a difficult situation I can either pretend to ignore it by filling my brain with stupid shit or maybe can tolerate it ? but for how long before I give into primal emotions

Self control is hard but a soul that has fought the fight with boredom should be more capable of it

I earn to be that soul\
Neither Hypocrite nor whore
