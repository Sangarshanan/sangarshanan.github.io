Hi, My name is Sangarshanan  (I can't prononce it either)

I like staring into the void, doing cool shit on my computer, talking about space and making dank memes 

I studied computer science and graduated from VIT vellore in 2019. I currently work at grofers on data related stuff. 

I tend to forget chunks of my life so I though it would be fun to write it down for me in the future 

Wow, you read the whole thing huh ... Thanks ... I guess
