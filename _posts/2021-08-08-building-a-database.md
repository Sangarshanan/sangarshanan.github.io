When I was in Recurse center I had started reading Designing data-intensive applications, The first couple of chapters gave were so crisp in conveying how databases work I felt confident I could build a toy DB of my own

I started working on it during my time there and even after it but then Dharamkot happened to me and I had kinda abandoned it, I felt bad about it cause I loved the project so I decided to pick it up again and hack something really basic that "Kinda works" for my soul be a little more content

I called it YeetDB 🏃 for the vine

And there is it: <https://github.com/sangarshanan/yeetdb>
