2020 was weird, i woke up one day and thought about choosing voilence but then decided i just need new friends so i applied to be a volunteer for EuroPython 2020, I was anyway speaking at the conference cause my proposal was accepted. i never knew then that i was gonna have the time of my life and meet some beautiful people that i wanna be forever besties with! I chose well that day.

So naturally i kept volunteering and helped onground at Dublin in 2022 and Prague in 2023, all through these years the love the warmth of the community still stayed so i felt like doing more! so i just took a leap and applied to be a board member so that i can be more closely involved in the organising of the event.

I still have no idea how but in the board elections i got voted IN! like whaaat?! so yeah i became a board member for the 2023-2024 term

Looking forward to more EuroPython energy in my life
