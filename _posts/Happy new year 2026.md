The 5th year I am writing this so this has become a ritual now.

Hello 2026

I started off 2025 at Dharamkot, Met old friends and made new ones, did trailrunning, lot of new trails (guna devi), 
bought myself a pair of Vibrams and did triund before I left to Bangalore

Aditi was there to greet me at the airport with flowers and we went on several dates after, Krishna my cousin got married and then I went to goa with PFC bois for Karacus maracus which ended up not happening but we had fun anyway

GOT INTO Music tech masters at UPF!!!

Went another Himachal trip in April with Aditi, We visited Shoja and then went to Dharamkot.

May: Headed to Pycon US to give my first tutorial "Building a Synthesizer with Python" visited NYC before and met the livecoding community there (Reckoner) attended a gig too, Got to see Nils Frahm live and it was wild
Went with Shrey back to Cali, we did the costal roadtrip and mushrooms in Golden Gate park

June: My official last month in PFC and living in Bangalore, I went to Goa to live with Aditi for a while and then we ended up finding a house in Siolim, Short trip to Mumbai for my Visa, met shetty, hiked to Kanheri caves

Lived in Goa throughout August, lot of Music, Hiking, Monsoon, Cafes, Bars and Dancing! I really loved living in Goa

September: Time to get back home and then Fly to Spain for the masters

First Trimester went well, made friends, felt along & lost, figuring out new life, getting used to being a student

Did ton of VL trips to places around Barcelona, Explored parks and trails around El Carmel, Finally moved to Raval, the brown capital of Barcelona

I keep playing at FromScratch shows every month here with Toplab Barcelona, Also got really into Strudel now and even did a workshop

I left beatoven and joined SingOneSong in August in Goa, worked till November but then my studies became more of a priority so i have stopped, Been doing more music these days, need to keep going

I realize practicing music will never have an end date, Its a forever activity and I just need to keep doing it

Might have gotten an Intership at Deezer! time will tell

This year is gonna be fun and critical cause future is a bit uncertain right now after April I don't know where I will be, Hopefully this is also the year I do the most music, that will be the goal for every year from now, As much as I code, run and hike, I wanna make music, these things make me happy and after 27 years of living I finally am beginning to understand what I want and life is heading in a direction that makes me excited and happy!

Cheers to you future self, Hope things are good in 2027 (How am i already so old)
