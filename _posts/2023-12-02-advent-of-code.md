Ok so i realised that even though i like building random shit as "side projects" and making recreational "art" with code i have never really liked solving puzzles cause it reminded me of college, the time when competitive coders came in clutch and were getting the big bread. I sucked and i believe still suck at leetcode type problems and combined with a timer i give up and sit in the corner waiting for the lord to take me

I think doing advent of code at my own pace might help? i am also gonna be trying it using non-Python languages, maybe Rust so i can pick some of that up too

Will be posting my solutions on Github: <https://github.com/Sangarshanan/advent-of-code-23>

Thanks K Bye.
