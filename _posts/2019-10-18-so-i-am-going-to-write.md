When staring into the void in my towel after a long bath, I recall really important life events and wonder what it felt like at that moment. That time I almost farted during an interview, That time I was on TV game show, that time I travelled alone to china, that time I got my first job offer. Some of these moments are really shaped me into the mess/non-mess that I am now. 

So I though I would write stuff down and maybe look back at them in the future. I am hoping this would prove helpful if my consciousness is cryogenically frozen and I need a refresher

I can sometimes Geek out, Rank relentlessly, Try to be funny, Szzsnswwk, Make no sense
