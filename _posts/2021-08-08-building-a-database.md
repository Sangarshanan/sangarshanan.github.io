When I was in Recurse center I had started reading Designing data-intensive applications, The first couple of chapters were so crisp in conveying how databases work that I felt confident I could build a toy DB of my own and so I did.

I started working on it during my time at RC and continued even after it but then "Dharamkot happened" and I kinda abandoned it. I felt bad about it cause I loved the project so I decided to give it another shot and pick it up again to hack something really basic that "Kinda works" for my soul be a little more content

I called it YeetDB 🏃 for the vine

And there is it: <https://github.com/sangarshanan/yeetdb>
