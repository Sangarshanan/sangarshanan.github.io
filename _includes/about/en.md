> Nostalgia is truly one of the great human weaknesses...second only to the neck. 

Hey there, This is my very own personal memoir kinda thing for me to look back to. I will document the stuff I learnt, did and enjoyed. Be prepared for selective musings with doses of cringe.

I am Sangarshanan, I am 21 years old. I love Memes, Computers, Music, Netflix and pretending to like popular culture to seem cool.

I went to VIT University and did by Bachelors in computer science

I currently work at Grofers !
